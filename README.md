# Stats-Project
Stats Spring 17

This project creates a web scraper using the external java library Jaunt. 
It uses web scrapers to gather data from a website about gas price data.
The objective of the project is to determine if a correlation between gas price and the gas station's proximity to other gas stations exists. 
This project is for the Statistics and Probability for Computer Scientists class at the University of Texas at El Paso.
